### Part 1 - Buidling VMs

---
- Operating System: Linux (Version: Ubuntu)
- Disk Space: I selected a Fixed Space of 15GB because I wanted to control how much was being taken from my host machine. If I had selected "Dynamically Allocated", the VM would
take what it would needed. With this I can organize my storage more and know what can and can't be installed. 
- Memory/Ram Allocation: I allocated 4000mb of space for ram, to allow plenty of extra space for storage if needed. Rather than filling it up and causing possible errors. 
- Tip: When creating your VM, it may not assume the Disk file you would like to use. When starting the machine a Optical Disk Selector Window may appear, click Add then point
it to the Ubuntu Desktop Iso file. 
- 3D Acceleration: This basically means you are giving your VM a virtual GPU, it can help with storage and from keeping your host machine from getting overhwelmed.
